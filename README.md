# Projects
### Mythical Money (Python)
- This is an economy app on Discord designed to simulate a Role-Player game.
- This was my first programming project that I was truly proud of.
- Having informally learned Python, this project taught me a lot I didn't now about the nature of the language.

### Mythical Manor (Java)
- To help myself learn Java, I wanted to recreate my original Mythical Money bot in Java.
- During this time, I also added a lot more creativity and used lots of objects to help optimize the app.

### Quick Assistant (Python)
- I created a Discord app to help with moderation in the server Quick Advertising.

### Blackjack (Python)
- I created a commissioned Discord app to allow users to play the card game Blackjack.
- The app featured all five moves (includig Split), proper buttons for interacting (revolutionary at the time), and adaptive Ace values.
