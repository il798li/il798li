# Projects
### Mythical Money (Python)
- This is an economy app on Discord designed to simulate a Role-Player game.
- This was my first programming project that I was truly proud of.
- Having informally learned Python, this project taught me a lot I didn't now about the nature of the language.

### Mythical Manor (Java)
- To help myself learn Java, I wanted to recreate my original Mythical Money bot in Java.
- During this time, I also added a lot more creativity and used lots of objects to help optimize the app.
  
### Rakshasa (GameMaker GMX)
- Using [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en) I made a simplified version of The Catacombs from Hypixel Skyblock.
- This was part of a project to make a Dungeon Crawler game in my Special Topics of Computer Science class.

### Rush Hour (GameMaker GMX)
- Using [GameMaker](https://gamemaker.io/en), I made a game where the player has to steal cars while avoiding the police.
- This was part of a post-AP unit in my AP Computer Science A class.
  
### Quick Assistant (Python)
- I created a Discord app to help with moderation in the server Quick Advertising.
- This app featured automatic warns for people who didn't advertise properly. Users could also create tickets to talk privately with staff for various reasons.

### Blackjack (Python)
- I created a commissioned Discord app to allow users to play the card game Blackjack.
- The app featured all five moves (includig Split), proper buttons for interacting (revolutionary at the time), and adaptive Ace values.
